# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Documentation site migrated from MkDocs Material to Astro Starlight. Catalog pages (entries, examples, diff-pairs, recipes, templates) are generated from taxonomy/ and examples/ by scripts/generate_site_pages.py and committed; every entry page now embeds its examples and cross-reference links. A freshness guard keeps generated pages in sync. The validator's YAML parsing moved to PyYAML (see ADR 0012). The site deploys to GitHub Pages.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

First catalog release, distributed through the Product on Purpose marketplace (`product-on-purpose/agent-plugins`).

### Added

- Three-axis composable model (Voice and Tone, Style, Format) with four catalog directories under `taxonomy/`
- 60 taxonomy entries, 15 per axis, each with frontmatter, language patterns, cross-references (`pairs_well_with`, `avoid_with`, `confusable_with`), `when_to_use` / `when_not_to_use`, and an `llm_instruction_phrasing` block
- `compose-instruction` skill (`skills/writing-instruction-builder/`) that assembles a prompt prefix from selected axis entries
- 195 worked examples across three anchor topics (async-standups, morning-routine, service-database-choice), 12 diff-pairs, and 5 horizontal-slice recipes
- JSON Schemas for all entry types and a 9-check validation suite (`tools/validate.py`) plus an index builder (`tools/build-indexes.py`), both wired into CI
- Dual license: Apache-2.0 for code, CC-BY-4.0 for content (see `NOTICE`)
- Repository scaffold, root documentation, contribution guide, and eight Architecture Decision Records

### Notes

- Distributed via the Product on Purpose marketplace registry and a self-hosted single-plugin marketplace in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- This is an early catalog release; see `ROADMAP.md` for what is planned next
